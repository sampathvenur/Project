KIDNEY STONE DETECTION - MODEL METRICS REPORT
=================================================
Generated on: 2025-12-01 05:17:41
Source Run: /content/runs/detect/train
Best Epoch: 20.0

1. PRIMARY METRICS (Cite these in your paper)
-------------------------------------------------
mAP@50 (Mean Average Precision @ 0.5 IoU): 0.7728
   -> In simple terms, this is your model's "Accuracy" for detection.
   -> A score > 0.5 is usually acceptable, > 0.8 is excellent.

mAP@50-95 (Strict Accuracy): 0.3404
   -> This measures how perfectly the box fits the stone.

2. DETAILED METRICS
-------------------------------------------------
Precision: 0.8276
   -> Out of all stones detected, how many were actually stones?

Recall: 0.7200
   -> Out of all real stones in the images, how many did we find?

3. TRAINING LOSS (At final epoch)
-------------------------------------------------
Box Loss: 1.8542
Class Loss: 0.9293
